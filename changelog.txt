4.0.0
-----
- all code moved into main generator class, :custom_rb option is no longer supported.
  please subclass the generator if you want to modify the behavior.
- d3.js is now included by default
- c3.js is now included by default
- split up toc.js into separate scripts, where each has its own responsibility,
  no longer by default highlight "passed", "failed" or "check" this is now the
  responsibility of user code via custom java script files (:js option in initialize)
- add Generator#javascript method, to insert arbitrary scripts at any place into the report.
  (was already possible via html method, but this simplifies the process by automatically adding
  CData tags around the code for better browser compatibility)
- support sync mode, i.e. all added content is written to disk immediately
    if enabled, calls to write() are no longer necessary. (Generator#sync = true)
- added examples on how to subclass.
- many methods (e.g. #code, #content) now support nil as value returned by the block

  and :data_is_xhtml true, invalid xhtml was produced.

  to customize individual cells.

-----
- #highlight and #highlight_captures now support html color codes as color input
- added following new methods
  - custom_table  (allows for customized attributes per cell / ranges and interpretation of table_data as html instead of text only)
- added following additional methods, which instead of inserting something into the report just return the html code
  as a string (in order to be used with the #custom_table method above, e.g. to construct table based layouts)
  - get_code_html
  - get_content_html
  - get_link_html
  - get_image_html
rest of the api remains backwardcompatible with version 3.0.x
